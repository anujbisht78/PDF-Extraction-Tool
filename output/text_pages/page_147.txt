as a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,
each called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each
chromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-
cell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either
maternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will
restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring
the stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance
explains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all
sexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms
also follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their
inheritance might work?

9.2.4 Sex Determination

We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual

reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number

of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual

determined? Different species use very different strategies

for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,

in some animals, the temperature at which fertilised eggs

are kept determines whether the animals developing in

the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as

snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is

not genetically determined. However, in human beings,

| the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined.

In other words, the genes inherited from our parents

decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we

have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from

both parents. If that is the case, how can genetic
inheritance determine sex?

The explanation lies in the fact that all human
chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes
have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22
such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is
odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a
perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men
have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X
while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,
while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the
inheritance pattern of X and Y will be?

As Fig. 9.6 shows, half the children will be boys and
half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome
from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or
girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by
what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits
an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one
who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.
