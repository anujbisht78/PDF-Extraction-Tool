In the electrolytic refining of a metal M, what would you take as the anode, the
cathode and the electrolyte?

Pratyush took sulphur powder on a spatula and heated it. He collected the gas
evolved by inverting a test tube over it, as shown in figure below.

(a) What will be the action of gas on
(i) dry litmus paper?
(ii) moist litmus paper?

(b) Write a balanced chemical
equation for the reaction
taking place.

State two ways to prevent the
rusting of iron.

. What type of oxides are formed when
non-metals combine with oxygen?

oxides during the process of
extraction.

Collection of gas

. You must have seen tarnished copper vessels being cleaned with lemon or tamarind
juice. Explain why these sour substances are effective in cleaning the vessels.

Differentiate between metal and non-metal on the basis of their chemical properties.

. Aman went door to door posing as a goldsmith. He promised to bring back the
glitter of old and dull gold ornaments. An unsuspecting lady gave a set of gold
bangles to him which he dipped in a particular solution. The bangles sparkled
like new but their weight was reduced drastically. The lady was upset but after a
