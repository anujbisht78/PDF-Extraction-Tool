Solution

We are given, R=4Q.

When a wire is doubled on it, its length would become half and
area of cross-section would double. That is, a wire of length land
area of cross-section A becomes of length [/2 and area of cross-
section 2A. From Eq. (12.10), we have

R=p—

The new resistance of the wire is 1 Q.

On what factors does the resistance of a conductor depend?

Will current flow more easily through a thick wire or a thin wire of the
same material, when connected to the same source? Why?

Let the resistance of an electrical component remains constant while
the potential difference across the two ends of the component decreases
to half of its former value. What change will occur in the current through
it?

Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of an alloy
rather than a pure metal?

Use the data in Table 12.2 to answer the following -—
(a) Which among iron and mercury is a better conductor?

(b) Which material is the best conductor?

12.6 RESISTANCE OF A SYSTEM OF RESISTORS

In preceding sections, we learnt about some simple electric circuits. We
have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its
resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical
gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore
intend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.

There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 12.6
shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R,,
R, and R,, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said
to be connected in series.
