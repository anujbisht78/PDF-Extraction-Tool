In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?
On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken
place?

Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10
and 3.11?

Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken
place.

Name the type of reaction.

Reactive metals can displace less
reactive metals from their compounds in
solution or molten form.

We have seen in the previous sections
that all metals are not equally reactive. We Test tube
checked the reactivity of various metals 170” nail
with oxygen, water and acids. But all — copper
metals do not react with these reagents. sulphate
So we were not able to put all the metal Solution
samples we had collected in decreasing
order of their reactivity. Displacement
reactions studied in Chapter 1 give better
evidence about the reactivity of metals. It
is simple and easy if metal A displaces
metal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.

Which metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your
observations in Activity 3.12?

3.2.5 The Reactivity Series

The reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their
decreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments
(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the
reactivity or activity series has been developed.
