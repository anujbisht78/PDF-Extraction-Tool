Let us perform some more decomposition reactions as given in
Activities 1.7 and 1.8.

a Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its

base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes. Oxygen

Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber

stoppers as shown in Fig. 1.6. Test tube
= Connect these electrodes to a 6 volt

battery. Graphite rod

a Fill the mug with water such that the
electrodes are immersed. Add a few drops
of dilute sulphuric acid to the water.

= Take two test tubes filled with water and Anode
invert them over the two carbon electrodes.
= Switch on the current and leave the Switch

apparatus undisturbed for some time.

= You will observe the formation of bubbles
at both the electrodes. These bubbles displace water in the
test tubes.

= Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes?

= Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases, remove
them carefully.

= Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close
to the mouth of the test tubes.
CAUTION: This step must be performed carefully by the teacher.
What happens in each case?

=m Which gas is present in each test tube?

Take about 2 g silver chloride in a china dish.
What is its colour?
Place this china dish in sunlight for some time
(Fig. 1.7).

= Observe the colour of the silver chloride after some
time.

You will see that white silver chloride turns grey in sunlight. This is
due to the decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine by

light.
