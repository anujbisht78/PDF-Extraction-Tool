The strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using a scale called the pH
scale (0-14) which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.

A neutral solution has a pH of exactly 7, while an acidic solution has a pH less
than 7 and a basic solution a pH more than 7.

Living beings carry out their metabolic activities within an optimal pH range.
Mixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a highly exothermic process.

Acids and bases neutralise each other to form corresponding salts and water.

Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules chemically attached
to each formula unit of a salt in its crystalline form.

Salts have various uses in everyday life and in indusiries.

A solution turns red litmus blue, its pH is likely to be
(a) 1 (b) 4 (c) 5 (d) 10

. Asolution reacts with crushed egg-shells to give a gas that turns lime-water milky.

The solution contains
(a) NaCl (b) HCl (ce) LiCl (d) KCl
10 mL of a solution of NaOH is found to be completely neutralised by 8 mL ofa

given solution of HCl. If we take 20 mL of the same solution of NaOH, the amount
HCI solution (the same solution as before) required to neutralise it will be

(a) 4mL (b) 8mL (c) 12mL (d) 16mL

. Which one of the following types of medicines is used for treating indigestion?

(a) Antibiotic
(b) Analgesic
(c) Antacid

(d) Antiseptic

. Write word equations and then balanced equations for the reaction taking

place when —

(a) dilute sulphuric acid reacts with zine granules.

(b) dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with magnesium ribbon.
(c) dilute sulphuric acid reacts with aluminium powder.

(d) dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with iron filings.

. Compounds such as alcohols and glucose also contain hydrogen but are not

categorised as acids. Describe an Activity to prove it.
