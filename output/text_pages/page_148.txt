How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or
recessive?

How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited
independently?

A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O and
their daughter has blood group O. Is this information enough to tell you
which of the traits — blood group A or O - is dominant? Why or why not?

How is the sex of the child determined in human beings?

9.3 EVOLUTION

We have noted that there is an inbuilt tendency to variation during
reproduction, both because of errors in DNA copying, and as a result of
sexual reproduction. Let us now look at some consequences of this
tendency.

9.3.1 An Illustration

Consider a group of twelve red beetles. They live, let us assume, in some
bushes with green leaves. Their population will grow by sexual
reproduction, and therefore, can generate variations. Let us imagine also
that crows eat these beetles. The more beetles the crows eat, the fewer
beetles are available to reproduce. Now, let us think about some different
situations (Fig. 9.7) that can develop in this beetle population.

Figure 9.7 Variations in a population — inherited and otherwise

In the first situation, a colour variation arises during reproduction,
so that there is one beetle that is green in colour instead of red. This
beetle, moreover, can pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all its
