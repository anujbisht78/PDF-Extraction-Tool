Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen from
the acids. This is seen as hydrogen gas. The metal combines with the
remaining part of the acid and forms a compound called a salt. Thus,
the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as —

Acid + Metal > Salt + Hydrogen gas

Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?

Activity 2.4

Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube.

Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents
of the test tube.

Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 2.3 and record your
observations.

The reaction that takes place can be written as follows.
2NaOH + Zn — Na,ZnO, + H,

(Sodium zincate)

You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However,
such reactions are not possible with all metals.

Hydrogencarbonates React with Acids?

Activity 2.5

Take two test tubes, label them as A
and B.
Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate
(Na,CO,) in test tube A and about
0.5 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate
Carbon dioxide gas (NaHCO,) in test tube B.

Dilute Test tube Add about 2 mL of dilute HCI to both

solution

The reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as —

Test tube A: Na,CO,(s) + 2HCl(aq) — 2NaCl(aq) + H,O() + CO, (g)
Test tube B: NaHCO, (s) + HCl(aq) ~ NaCl(aq) + H,O) + CO, (g)
On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,

Ca(OH), (aq) + CO, (g) > Caco,(s) + H,O()
(Lime water) (White precipitate)
