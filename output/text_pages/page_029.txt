Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair,
which cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic
acid secreted by them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the

area with the leaf of the dock plant, which often grows beside
the nettle in the wild. Can you guess the nature of the dock
plant? So next time you know what to look out for if you
accidentally touch a nettle plant while trekking. Are you aware
of any other effective traditional remedies for such stings?

You have two solutions, A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of
solution B is 8. Which solution has more hydrogen ion concentration?
Which of this is acidic and which one is basic?

What effect does the concentration of H*(aq) ions have on the nature of the
solution?

Do basic solutions also have H*(aq) ions? If yes, then why are these basic?
Under what soil condition do you think a farmer would treat the soil of his
fields with quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or
chalk (calcium carbonate)?
