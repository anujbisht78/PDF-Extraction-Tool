Figure 12.6 Resistors in series

Figure 12.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors
are connected together between points X and Y. Here, the resistors are
said to be connected in parallel.

12.6.1 Resistors in Series

What happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are
connected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent
resistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following
activities.

Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them
with a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 12.6.
You may use the resistors of values like 1 Q, 2 Q, 3 Q etc., anda
battery of 6 V for performing this Activity.

Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.

Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the
resistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.

Do you find any change in the value of current through the
ammeter?
