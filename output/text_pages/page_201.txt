The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent
to the charge contained in nearly 6 x 10'* electrons. (We know that
an electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 x 107!°C.) The electric
current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the
French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836). One ampere is
constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that
is, 1 A= 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in
milliampere (1 mA = 10° A) or in microampere
(1 pA = 10° A). An instrument called ammeter
measures electric current in a circuit. It is always
connected in series in a circuit through which
the current is to be measured. Figure 12.1 shows
the schematic diagram of a typical electric circuit
comprising a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter
and a plug key. Note that the electric current
flows in the circuit from the positive terminal of
the cell to the negative terminal of the cell through
the bulb and ammeter.

Example 12.1

A current of 0.5 Ais drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10
minutes. Find the amount of electric charge that flows through the
circuit.

Solution
We are given, [= 0.5 A; t= 10 min = 600 s.
From Eq. (12.1), we have
Q = it
= 0.5Ax 600s
= 300C
