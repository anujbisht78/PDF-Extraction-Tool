Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller tubes
which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which are called
alveoli. The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can
take place. The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive network of
blood-vessels. As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we
lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes
larger as a result. Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills
the expanded alveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of
the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air
is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to
all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is taken
in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so
that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon
dioxide to be released.

When the body size of animals is large, the diffusion pressure alone
cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Instead,
respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry
it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it. In human
beings, the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high
affinity for oxygen. This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles.
Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is
mostly transported in the dissolved form in our blood.
