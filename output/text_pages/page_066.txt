But, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon
‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different ‘skeletons’
are possible —

C—C—C—C CoN

Filling the remaining valencies with hydrogen gives us —

We see that both these structures have the same formula C,H,,. Such
compounds with identical molecular formula but different structures
are called structural isomers.

In addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds
have carbon atoms arranged in the form ofa ring. For example, cyclohexane
has the formula C,H,, and the following structure —

Can you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight
chain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated
or unsaturated. For example, benzene, C,H,, has the following structure —

All these carbon compounds which contain just carbon and hydrogen
are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated hydrocarbons are
called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or
more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing one or more

triple bonds are called alkynes.

4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?

Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking
at compounds of carbon and hydrogen. But carbon also forms bonds
