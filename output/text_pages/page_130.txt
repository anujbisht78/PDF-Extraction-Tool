8.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE
ORGANISMS

Activity 8.1

Dissolve about 10 gm of sugar in 100 mL of water.

Take 20 mL of this solution in a test tube and add a pinch of yeast
granules to it.

Put a cotton plug on the mouth of the test tube and keep it ina
warm place.

After 1 or 2 hours, put a small drop of yeast culture from the test
tube on a slide and cover it with a coverslip.

Observe the slide under a microscope.

Activity 8.2

Wet a slice of bread, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.
Observe the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.
Record your observations for a week.

Compare and contrast the ways in which yeast grows in the first
case, and how mould grows in the second.

Having discussed the context in which reproductive processes work,
let us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The
modes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body
design of the organisms.

8.2.1 Fission

For unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation
of new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.
Many bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during
cell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells
during division can take place in any plane.

Observe a permanent slide of ’ : : @
Amoeba under a microscope. boron fa CZrO@
Similarly observe another / en
permanent slide of Amoeba
showing binary fission.

Now, compare the observations of

both the slides. Figure 8.1 Binary fission in Amoeba

However, some unicellular organisms show somewhat more
organisation of their bodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which cause
kala-azarn, which have a whip-like structure at one end of the cell. In
such organisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation
