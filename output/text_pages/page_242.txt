How does a solenoid behave like a magnet? Can you determine the north and
south poles of a current-carrying solenoid with the help of a bar magnet? Explain.

. When is the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic
field largest?

. Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall. An electron
beam, moving horizontally from back wall towards the front wall, is deflected by a
strong magnetic field to your right side. What is the direction of magnetic field?

. Draw a labelled diagram of an electric motor. Explain its principle and working.
What is the function of a split ring in an electric motor?

. Name some devices in which electric motors are used.

. Acoil of insulated copper wire is connected to a galuanometer. What will happen if
a bar magnet is (i) pushed into the coil, (ii) withdrawn from inside the coil, (iii) held
stationary inside the coil?

Two circular coils A and B are placed closed to each other. If the current in the coil
A is changed, will some current be induced in the coil B? Give reason.

State the rule to determine the direction of a (i) magnetic field produced around a
straight conductor-carrying current, (ii) force experienced by a current-carrying
straight conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it, and
(iii) current induced in a coil due to its rotation in a magnetic field.

. Explain the underlying principle and working of an electric generator by drawing
a labelled diagram. What is the function of brushes?

When does an electric short circuit occur?

What is the function of an earth wire? Why is it necessary to earth metallic
appliances?
