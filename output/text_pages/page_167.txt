Figure 10.7 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror

Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in
Table 10.1.

You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous section
for locating the image.

Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 10.7.

Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed
in each case.

Tabulate the results in a convenient format.

Uses of concave mirrors

Concave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and
vehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are
often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The
dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.
Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce
heat in solar furnaces.

(b) Image formation by a Convex Mirror
We studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall
study the formation of image by a convex mirror.
