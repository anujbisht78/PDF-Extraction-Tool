First use only one cell as the source in the
circuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I,
for the current and reading of the voltmeter
V for the potential difference across the
nichrome wire XY in the circuit. Tabulate
them in the Table given.

Next connect two cells in the circuit and
note the respective readings of the ammeter
and voltmeter for the values of current
through the nichrome wire and potential
difference across the nichrome wire.
Repeat the above steps using three cells
and then four cells in the circuit separately.
Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of

V-I graph for a nichrome wire. A
straight line plot shows that as the
current through a wire increases, the
potential difference across the wire
increases linearly — this is Ohm’s law.

In this Activity, you will find that approximately the
same value for V/Iis obtained in each case. Thus the V-I
graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of
the graph, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Thus, V/Iis a constant
ratio.

In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm
(1787-1854) found out the relationship between the current
I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across
its terminals. He stated that the electric current flowing
through a metallic wire is directly proportional to the
potential difference V, across its ends provided its
temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In
other words —

In Eq. (12.4), Ris a constant for the given metallic wire
at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the
property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges
