(ii) A ray passing through the
principal focus of a concave
mirror or a ray which is
directed towards the
principal focus of a convex
mirror, after reflection, will
emerge parallel to the
principal axis. This is
illustrated in Fig.10.4 (a)
and (b). @ (b)

of curvature of a convex ee ie
mirror, after reflection, is —
reflected back along the
same path. This is
illustrated in Fig.10.5 (a)
and (b). The light rays come (a) )
back along the same path
because the incident rays
fall on the mirror along the
normal to the reflecting
surface.

(iv) A ray incident obliquely to
the principal axis, towards
a point P (pole of the mirror),
on the concave mirror
[Fig. 10.6 (a)] or a convex
mirror [Fig. 10.6 (b)], is Cc FL
reflected obliquely. The
incident and reflected rays
follow the laws of reflection
at the point of incidence
(point P), making equal Figure 10.6
angles with the principal axis.

Remember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.
At the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that
the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

(a) Image formation by Concave Mirror
Figure 10.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image
by a concave mirror for various positions of the object.
