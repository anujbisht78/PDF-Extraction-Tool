How do we know how old the fossils are? There are two components
to this estimation. One is relative. Ifwe dig into the earth and start finding
fossils, it is reasonable to suppose that the fossils we find closer to the
surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. The
second way of dating fossils is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes
of the same element in the fossil material. It would be interesting to find
out exactly how this method works!

How do fossils form layer by layer?

ll Let us start 100 million years ago. Some invertebrates on
rn the sea-bed die, and are buried in the sand. More sand

RS * accumulates, and sandstone forms under pressure.

Millions of years later, dinosaurs living in the area die, and their bodies, too, are
buried in mud. This mud is also compressed into rock, above the rock containing
the earlier invertebrate fossils.

Again millions of years later, the bodies of horse-like creatures dying in the area are
fossilised in rocks above these earlier rocks.

Much later, by erosion or water flow wears away some of the rock and exposes the
horse-like fossils. As we dig deeper, we will find older and older fossils.
