A ray of light passing
through a principal
focus, after refraction
from a convex lens, will
emerge parallel to the
principal axis. This is
shown in Fig. 10.14 (a).
A ray of light appearing
to meet at the principal
focus of a concave lens,
after refraction, will
emerge parallel to the
principal axis. This is
shown in Fig.10.14 (b).
A ray of light passing
through the optical
centre of a lens will
emerge without any
deviation. This is
illustrated in Fig. 10. 15(a)
and Fig.10.15 (b).

The ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few
positions of the object are shown in Fig. 10.16. The ray diagrams
representing the image formation in a concave lens for various positions

of the object are shown in Fig. 10.17.
