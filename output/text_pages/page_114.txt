In human beings, excretory products in the form of soluble nitrogen compounds
are removed by the nephrons in the kidneys.

Plants use a variety of techniques to get rid of waste material. For example, waste
material may be stored in the cell-vacuoles or as gum and resin, removed in the
falling leaves, or excreted into the surrounding soil.

The kidneys in human beings are a part of the system for
(a) nutrition.

(b) respiration.

(c) excretion.

(d) transportation.

The xylem in plants are responsible for

(a) transport of water.

(b) transport of food.

(ce) transport of amino acids.

(d) transport of oxygen.

The autotrophic mode of nutrition requires

(a) carbon dioxide and water.

(b) chlorophyll.

(c) sunlight.

(d) allofthe above.

The breakdown of pyruvate to give carbon dioxide, water and energy takes place in
(a) cytoplasm.

(b) mitochondria.

(ce) chloroplast.

(d) nucleus.
