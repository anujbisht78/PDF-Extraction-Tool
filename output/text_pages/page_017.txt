Perform the following activity.
Take four beakers and label them as A, B, C and D.
Put 25 mL of water in A, B and C beakers and copper sulphate solution in beaker D.
Measure and record the temperature of each liquid contained in the beakers above.

Add two spatulas of potassium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, anhydrous copper
sulphate and fine iron fillings to beakers A, B, C and D respectively and stir.

Finally measure and record the temperature of each of the mixture above.
Find out which reactions are exothermic and which ones are endothermic in nature.
