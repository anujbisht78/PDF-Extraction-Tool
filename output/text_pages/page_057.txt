Non-metals form negatively charged ions by gaining electrons when reacting with
metals.

Non-metals form oxides which are either acidic or neutral.

Non-metals do not displace hydrogen from dilute acids. They react with hydrogen
to form hydrides.

Which of the following pairs will give displacement reactions?
(a) NaCl solution and copper metal

(b) MgCl, solution and aluminium metal

(c) FeSO, solution and silver metal

(d) AgNO, solution and copper metal.

Which of the following methods is suitable for preventing an iron frying pan from
rusting?

(a) Applying grease

(b) Applying paint

(c) Applying a coating of zinc

(d) All of the above.

An element reacts with oxygen to give a compound with a high melting point. This
compound is also soluble in water. The element is likely to be

(a) calcium

(b) carbon

(c) silicon

(d) iron.

Food cans are coated with tin and not with zinc because

(a) zinc is costlier than tin.

(b) zinc has a higher melting point than tin.

(c) zinc is more reactive than tin.

(d) zinc is less reactive than tin.

You are given a hammer, a battery, a bulb, wires and a switch.

(a) How could you use them to distinguish between samples of metals and
non-metals?

(b) Assess the usefulness of these tests in distinguishing between metals and
non-metals.

What are amphoteric oxides? Give two examples of amphoteric oxides.

Name two metals which will displace hydrogen from dilute acids, and two metals
which will not.
