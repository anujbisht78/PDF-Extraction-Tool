Evolution cannot be said to ‘progress’ from ‘lower’ forms to ‘higher’ forms. Rather,
evolution seems to have given rise to more complex body designs even while the
simpler body designs continue to flourish.

Study of the evolution of human beings indicates that all of us belong to a single
species that evolved in Africa and spread across the world in stages.

A Mendelian experiment consisted of breeding tall pea plants bearing violet flowers
with short pea plants bearing white flowers. The progeny all bore violet flowers,
but almost half of them were short. This suggests that the genetic make-up of the
tall parent can be depicted as

(a) TIWW

(b) TIww

(c) TYWW

(dq) TiWw

An example of homologous organs is
(a) ourarm and a dog’s fore-leg.

(b) ourteeth and an elephant’s tusks.
(c) potato and runners of grass.

(d) allofthe above.

In evolutionary terms, we have more in common with
(a) aChinese school-boy.

(b) achimpanzee.

(c) aspider.

(d) abacterium.

A study found that children with light-coloured eyes are likely to have parents
with light-coloured eyes. On this basis, can we say anything about whether the
light eye colour trait is dominant or recessive? Why or why not?

How are the areas of study — evolution and classification — interlinked?
Explain the terms analogous and homologous organs with examples.
Outline a project which aims to find the dominant coat colour in dogs.
Explain the importance of fossils in deciding evolutionary relationships.
What evidence do we have for the origin of life from inanimate matter?

Explain how sexual reproduction gives rise to more viable variations than asexual
reproduction. How does this affect the evolution of those organisms that reproduce
sexually?

How is the equal genetic contribution of male and female parents ensured in the
progeny?

Only variations that confer an advantage to an individual organism will survive in
a population. Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not?
