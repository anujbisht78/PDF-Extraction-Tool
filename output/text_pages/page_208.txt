resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of
cross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements
have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly
proportional to its length (J) and inversely proportional to the area of
cross-section (A). That is,

Rel (12.8)
and R«1l/A (12.9)
Combining Eqs. (12.8) and (12.9) we get
Re &
“A
R= L (12.10)
or, =P .

where p (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical
resistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is
Q m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys
have very low resistivity in the range of 1O* Qmto 10° Q m. They are
good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have
resistivity of the order of 10! to 10!” Q m. Both the resistance and
resistivity of a material vary with temperature.

Table 12.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher
than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily
at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in
electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used
almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and
aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.
