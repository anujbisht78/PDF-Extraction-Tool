take place in an organised
sequence referred to as
development. However,
regeneration is not the same
as reproduction, since most
organisms would not
normally depend on being cut
up to be able to reproduce.

8.2.4 Budding

Organisms such as Hydra

use regenerative cells for

reproduction in the process of

budding. In Hydra, a bud

Figure 8.3 Regeneration in Planaria develops as an outgrowth due

to repeated cell division at one

specific site (Fig. 8.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when

fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent
individuals.

8.2.5 Vegetative Propagation

There are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves
develop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most
animals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This
property of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering
or grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for
agricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear
lowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods
also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,
rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another
advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are
genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its
characteristics.
