air pollution.

16.5 AN OVERVIEW OF NATURAL RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT

Sustainable management of natural resources is a difficult task. In
addressing this issue, we need to keep an open mind with regard to the
interests of various stakeholders. We need to accept that people will act
with their own best interests as the priority. But the realisation that
such selfish goals will lead to misery for a large number of people and a
total destruction of our environment is slowly growing. Going beyond
laws, rules and regulations, we need to tailor our requirements,
individually and collectively, so that the benefits of development reach
everyone now and _for all generations to come.

Our resources like forests, wild life, water, coal and petroleum need to be used ina
sustainable manner.

We can reduce pressure on the environment by sincerely applying the maxim of
‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’ in our lives.

Management of forest resources has to take into account the interests of various
stakeholders.

The harnessing of water resources by building dams has social, economic and
environmental implications. Alternatives to large dams exist. These are locale-specific
and may be developed so as to give local people control over their local resources.

The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum, will ultimately be exhausted. Because of this
and because their combustion pollutes our environment, we need to use these
resources judiciously.

1. What changes would you suggest in your home in order to be environment-friendly?

2. Can you suggest some changes in your school which would make it environment-
friendty?

3. We saw in this chapter that there are four main stakeholders when it comes to
forests and wildlife. Which among these should have the authority to decide the
management of forest produce? Why do you think so?
