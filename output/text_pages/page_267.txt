CHAPTER 4 6
* Management of
/=t Natural Resources

We learnt in Class IX, about some natural resources like soil, air
and water and how various components are cycled over and over
again in nature. In the previous chapter we also learnt about the pollution
of these resources because of some of our activities. In this chapter, we
shail look at some of our resources and how we are using them. May be
we should also think about how we ought to be using our resources so
as to sustain the resources and conserve our environment. We shall be
looking at our natural resources like forests, wild-life, water, coal and
petroleum and see what are the issues at stake in deciding how these
resources are to be managed _for sustainable development.

We often hear or read about environmental problems. These are often
global-level problems and we feel helpless to make any changes. There
are international laws and regulations, and then there are our own
national laws and acts for environmental protection. There are also
national and international organisations working towards protecting our
environment.

Activity 16.1

Find out about the international norms to regulate the emission
of carbon dioxide.

Have a discussion in class about how we can contribute towards
meeting those norms.

Activity 16.2

There are a number of organisations that seek to spread awareness
about our environment and promote activities and attitudes that
lead to the conservation of our environment and natural resources.
Find out about the organisation(s) active in your neighbourhood /
village/town / city.

Find out how you can contribute towards the same cause.

Awareness about the problems caused by unthinkingly exploiting
our resources has been a fairly recent phenomenon in our society. And
once this awareness rises, some action is usually taken. You must have
heard about the Ganga Action Plan. This multi-crore project came about
in 1985 because the quality of the water in the Ganga was very poor
