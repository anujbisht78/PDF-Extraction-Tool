Figure 3.6 Formation of magnesium chloride

The compounds formed in this manner by the transfer of electrons
from a metal to a non-metal are known as ionic compounds or
electrovalent compounds. Can you name the cation and anion present
in MgCl,?

3.3.1 Properties of lonic Compounds

To learn about the properties of ionic compounds, let us perform the
following Activity:

Spatula
containing
sample

Take samples of sodium chloride, potassium iodide, barium
chloride or any other salt from the science laboratory.
What is the physical state of these salts?

Burner Take a small amount of a sample on a metal spatula and
heat directly on the flame (Fig. 3.7). Repeat with other samples.
What did you observe? Did the samples impart any colour
to the flame? Do these compounds melt?
Try to dissolve the samples in water, petrol and kerosene.

Figure 3.7 Are they soluble?
Heating a salt sample ona Make a circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8 and insert the electrodes
spatula into a solution of one salt. What did you observe? Test the
Battery Bulb other salt samples too in this manner.
HE g. Switch What is your inference about the nature of these
C | compounds?
