The human eye forms the image of an object at its

(a) cornea. (b) iris. (c) pupil. (d) retina.

The least distance of distinct vision for a young adult with normal vision is about
(a) 25m. (b) 2.5 cm. (c) 25 cm. (d) 2.5m.

The change in focal length of an eye lens is caused by the action of the

(a) pupil. (b) retina.

(c) ciliary muscles. (d) iris.

. A person needs a lens of power —5.5 dioptres for correcting his distant vision. For
correcting his near vision he needs a lens of power +1.5 dioptre. What is the focal
length of the lens required for correcting (i) distant vision, and (ii) near vision?

The far point of a myopic person is 80 em in front of the eye. What is the nature and

power of the lens required to correct the problem?

Make a diagram to show how hypermetropia is corrected. The near point of a
hypermetropic eye is 1 m. What is the power of the lens required to correct this
defect? Assume that the near point of the normal eye is 25 cm.

Why is a normal eye not able to see clearly the objects placed closer than
25 ecm?

What happens to the image distance in the eye when we increase the distance of an
object from the eye?

. Why do stars twinkle?

. Explain why the planets do not twinkle.

. Why does the Sun appear reddish early in the morning?

. Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?
