Why do HCl, HNO,, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions
while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic
character?

Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?
Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?

While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be
added to water and not water to the acid?

How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H,O*) affected when a
solution of an acid is diluted?

How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH) affected when excess
base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?

2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between
an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about
dilution and decrease in concentration of Ht or OH ions in solutions.
Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?
Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?

We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a
mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different
colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.

Ascale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called
pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz in German,
meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH from 0 (very acidic)
to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which
indicates the acidic or basic nature ofa solution. Higher the hydronium
ion concentration, lower is the pH value.

The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale
represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it
represents an increase in OH ion concentration in the solution, that is,
increase in the strength of alkali. Generally paper impregnated with the
universal indicator is used for measuring pH. One such paper is shown
in Fig. 2.6.
