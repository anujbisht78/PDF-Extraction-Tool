electrons is decreasing because the outermost electrons are farther away
from the nucleus. Therefore, these can be lost easily. Hence metallic
character decreases across a period and increases down a group.
Non-metals, on the other hand, are electronegative. They tend to form
bonds by gaining electrons. Let us learn about the variation of this

property.

Activity 5.11

How would the tendency to gain electrons change as you go from
left to right across a period?

How would the tendency to gain electrons change as you go down
a group?

As the trends in the electronegativity show, non-metals are found on
the right-hand side of the Periodic Table towards the top.

These trends also help us to predict the nature of oxides formed by
the elements because it is known to you that the oxides of metals are
basic and that of non-metals are acidic in general.
