The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive
index. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 10.3. From
the Table you can know that the refractive index of water, n,, = 1.33.
This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of
light in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown
glass, n, =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you
need not memorise the data.

Note from Table 10.3 that an optically denser medium may not
possess greater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher
refractive index, is optically denser than water, although its mass density
is less than water.

The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.
Optical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have
been using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser mediumy in this Chapter. It actually
means ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can

we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the
one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other
medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer
medium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium toa
denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a
denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.
