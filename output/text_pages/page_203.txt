potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor
when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one

point to the other.
1 joule
Therefore, 1 volt = ————__ (12.3)
1 coulomb
1V =1JC'!

The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the
points between which the potential difference is to be measured.

Example 12.2
How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points
having a potential difference 12 V?

Solution

The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential
difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in
moving the charge [from Eq. (12.2)] is

W = VQ
12Vx2C
24 J.

Q U ES TION $

Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a
conductor.

What is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points
is 1 V?

How much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a
6 V battery?

12.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM

We know that an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 12.1, comprises a cell
(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.
It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different
components of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently
used. Conventional symbols used to represent some of the most
commonly used electrical components are given in Table 12.1.
