On passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place:
CaCO, (s)+ H,O()+ CO,(g) > Ca(HCO,), (aq)

(Soluble in water)

Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate.
All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a
corresponding salt, carbon dioxide and water.

Thus, the reaction can be summarised as —

Metal carbonate/ Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid > Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water

2.1.4 How do Acids and Bases React with each other?

Activity 2.6

Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add
two drops of phenolphthalein solution.

What is the colour of the solution?

Add dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop.

Is there any colour change for the reaction mixture?

Why did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition
of an acid?

Now add a few drops of NaOH to the above mixture.

Does the pink colour of phenolphthalein reappear?

Why do you think this has happened?

In the above Activity, we have observed that the effect of a base is
nullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as —

NaOH[aq) + HCl(aq) > NaCl(aq) + H,O()

The reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is
known as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction
can be written as —

Base + Acid > Salt + Water
2.1.5 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids
Activity 2.7

Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute
hydrochloric acid slowly while stirring.

Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper
oxide?

You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green
and the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is
due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general
reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as —

Metal oxide + Acid > Salt + Water
