Figure 1.8 (b) Iron nails and copper sulphate solutions compared before and after the experiment

Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour
of copper sulphate solution fade?
The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity—

Fe(s) + CuSO (aq) > FeSO (aq) + Cu(s) (1.24)
(Copper sulphate) (Iron sulphate)

In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,
copper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as
displacement reaction.

Other examples of displacement reactions are

Zn(s) + CuSO ,faq) > ZnSO,(aq) + Cu(s) (1.25)
(Copper sulphate) (Zine sulphate)

Pb(s) + CuCl(aq) — PbCl,(aq) + Cu(s) (1.26)
(Copper chloride) (Lead chloride)

Zinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace
copper from its compounds.

1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction

Activity 1.10

= Take about 3 mL of sodium sulphate
solution in a test tube.

= In another test tube, take about 3 mL of
barium chloride solution.

= Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9).

You will observe that a white substance, which is of barium chloride

insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance

formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that Figure 1.9
produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction. Formation of barium
