12.4 OHM’'S LAW

Is there a relationship between the potential difference across a conductor
and the current through it? Let us explore with an Activity.

Activity 12.1

= Set up a circuit as shown in Fig. 12.2, consisting of a nichrome wire XY of length, say 0.5
m, an ammeter, a voltmeter and four cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an alloy of nickel,
chromium, manganese, and iron metals.)
