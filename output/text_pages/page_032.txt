Bleaching powder is used —

(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching
wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes
in laundry;

(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and
(iii) for disinfecting drinking water to make it free of germs.

Baking soda

The soda commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy pakoras
is baking soda. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical
name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO,). It is
produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.

Did you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?
Can you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild
non-corrosive base. The following reaction takes place when it is heated
during cooking —

Sodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.

Uses of sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO,)

(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda
(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
the following reaction takes place —

Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction causes bread or cake

to rise making them soft and spongy.

(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.

(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.

Washing soda

Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is
Na,CO,.10H,O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium
carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of
sodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basie salt.
