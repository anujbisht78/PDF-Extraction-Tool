(II) Preparing a soda-acid fire extinguisher

The reaction of acids with metal hydrogencarbonates is used in the fire extinguishers
which produce carbon dioxide.

Take 20 mL of sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO,) solution in a wash-bottle.
Suspend an ignition tube containing dilute sulphuric acid in the wash-bottle
(Fig. 2.10).

Close the mouth of the wash-bottle.

Tilt the wash-bottle so that the acid from the ignition tube mixes with the sodium
hydrogencarbonate solution below.

You will notice an effervescence coming out of the nozzle.
Direct this gas on a burning candle. What happens?
