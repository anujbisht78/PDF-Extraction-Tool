Another way of tracing evolutionary relationships depends on the
original idea that we started with. That idea was that changes in DNA
during reproduction are the basic events in evolution. If that is the case,
then comparing the DNA of different species should give us a direct estimate
of how much the DNA has changed during the formation of these species.
This method is now extensively used to define evolutionary relationships.

Molecular phylogeny
We have been discussing how changes in the DNA during cell division would lead to changes
in the proteins that are made from this new DNA. Another point that has been made is that
these changes would accumulate from one generation to the next. Could this be used to
trace the changes in DNA backwards in time and find out where each change diverged
from the other? Molecular phylogeny does exactly this. This approach is based on the idea
that organisms which are more distantly related will accumulate a greater number of
differences in their DNA. Such studies trace the evolutionary relationships and it has been
highly gratifying to find that the relationships among different organisms shown by molecular

phylogeny match the classification scheme that we learnt in Class IX.

Give an example of characteristics being used to determine how close
two species are in evolutionary terms.

Can the wing of a butterfly and the wing of a bat be considered
homologous organs? Why or why not?

What are fossils? What do they tell us about the process of evolution?

9.6 EVOLUTION SHOULD NOT BE EQUATED WITH
‘PROGRESS’

In an exercise of tracing the family trees of species, we need to remember
certain things. Firstly, there are multiple branches possible at each and
