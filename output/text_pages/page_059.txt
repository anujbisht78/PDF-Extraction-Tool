th Carbon and its
TH Compounds

n the last Chapter, we came to know many compounds of importance

to us. In this Chapter we will be studying about some more interesting
compounds and their properties. Also we shall be learning about carbon,
an element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental
form and in the combined form.

Things made | Things made
of metal of glass/clay

Make a list of ten things you have
used or consumed since the morning.
Compile this list with the lists made
by your classmates and then sort the
items into the following Table.

If there are items which are made up
of more than one material, put them
into both the relevant columns.

Look at the items that come in the last column — your teacher will be
able to tell you that most of them are made up of compounds of carbon.
Can you think of a method to test this? What would be the product ifa
compound containing carbon is burnt? Do you know of any test to
confirm this?

Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed
are all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living
structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s
crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only
0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-
carbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon
dioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the
importance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will be
looking at the properties of carbon which lead to this anomaly.

4.1 BONDING IN CARBON — THE COVALENT BOND

In the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic
compounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling
points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also
