What causes this? The white precipitate of BaSO, is formed by the
reaction of SO? and Ba”*. The other product formed is sodium chloride
which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an

exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
reactions.

Recall Activity 1.2, where you have mixed the solutions of lead(II) nitrate

and potassium iodide.

(i) What was the colour of the precipitate formed? Can you name the compound
precipitated?

(ii) Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.

(iii) Is this also a double displacement reaction?

a What do you observe?

Burner
The surface of copper powder becomes coated with

] black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black
= substance formed?
This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.

If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black
coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place
and copper is obtained.

Ifa substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
Ifa substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.

During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
or redox reactions.
