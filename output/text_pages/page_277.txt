Figure 16.3 Traditional water harvesting system — an ideal setting of the khadin system

In largely level terrain, the water harvesting structures are mainly
crescent shaped earthen embankments or low, straight concrete-and-
rubble “check dams” built across seasonally flooded gullies. Monsoon
rains fill ponds behind the structures. Only the largest structures hold
water year round; most dry up six months or less after the monsoons.
Their main purpose, however, is not to hold surface water but to recharge
the ground water beneath. The advantages of water stored in the ground
are many. It does not evaporate, but spreads out to recharge wells and
provides moisture for vegetation over a wide area. In addition, it does
not provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes like stagnant water collected
in ponds or artificial lakes. The ground-water is also relatively protected
from contamination by human and animal waste.

QUESTIONS

Find out about the traditional systems of water harvesting/management
in your region.

Compare the above system with the probable systems in hilly/
mountainous areas or plains or plateau regions.

Find out the source of water in your region/locality. Is water from this
source available to all people living in that area?

16.4 COAL AND PETROLEUM

We have seen some of the issues involved in the conservation and
sustainable use of resources like forests, wild-life and water. These can
meet our needs perpetually if we were to use them in a sustainable
manner. Now we come to yet another important resource — fossil fuels,
that is, coal and petroleum, which are important sources of energy for
us. Since the industrial revolution, we have been using increasing
amounts of energy to meet our basic needs and _for the manufacture of a
