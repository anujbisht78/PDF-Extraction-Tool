this Chapter.

Il Take about 20 mL of castor oil/cotton seed oil/linseed oil/soyabean oil in a
beaker. Add 30 mL of 20 % sodium hydroxide solution. Heat the mixture with
continuous stirring for a few minutes till the mixture thickens. Add 5-10 g of
common salt to this. Stir the mixture well and allow it to cool.

You can cut out the soap in fancy shapes. You can also add perfume to the
