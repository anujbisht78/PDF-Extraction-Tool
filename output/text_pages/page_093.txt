Nitrogen (atomic number 7) and phosphorus (atomic number 15) belong to
group 15 of the Periodic Table. Write the electronic configuration of these two
elements. Which of these will be more electronegative? Why?

How does the electronic configuration of an atom relate to its position in the Modern
Periodic Table?

Compare and contrast the arrangement of elements in Mendeléev’s Periodic Table
and the Modern Periodic Table.

I We have discussed the major attempts made for classifying elements. Find out
(from the internet or library) about other attempts to classify elements.

Il We have studied the long form of the Periodic Table. The Modern Periodic Law has
been used to arrange elements in other ways too. Find out what are these.
