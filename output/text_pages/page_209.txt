Example 12.3

(a) How much current will an electric bulb draw from a 220 V source,
if the resistance of the bulb filament is 1200 Q? (b) How much
current will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if
the resistance of the heater coil is 100 Q?

Solution
(a) We are given V= 220 V; R= 1200 Q.

From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I= 220 V/1200 QO =0.18A.
(b) We are given, V=220 V, R= 100 Q.

From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I= 220 V/100 Q=2.2 A.
Note the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric
heater from the same 220 V source!

Example 12.4

The potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater is
60 V when it draws a current of 4 A from the source. What current
will the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V?

Solution

We are given, potential difference V= 60 V, current [=4 A.
Vv 60V

According to Ohm’s law, R = T7a4a7 15 Q,

When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is
given by

(-¥ _120V
current = 5 = 75
The current through the heater becomes 8 A.

=8A,

Example 12.5

Resistance ofa metal wire of length 1 mis 26 Q at 20°C. Ifthe diameter
of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that
temperature? Using Table 12.2, predict the material of the wire.

Solution

We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Q, the diameter
d=0.3 mm = 3 x 10% m, and the length lof the wire = 1 m.
Therefore, from Eq. (12.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is
p = (RA/)) = (Rad?’/4l)

Substitution of values in this gives

p= 1.84x10%°Qm

The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 x 108 QO m. From
Table 12.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.

Example 12.6
A4Q resistance wire is doubled on it. Calculate the new resistance
of the wire.
