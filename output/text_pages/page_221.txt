Solution
The total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be
400 W x 8.0 hour/day x 30 days = 96000 W h
=96kWh
Thus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is
96 kW h x Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00

What determines the rate at which energy is delivered by a current?

An electric motor takes 5 A from a 220 V line. Determine the power of
the motor and the energy consumed in 2 h.

Astream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current.
Conventionally, the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of
electrons.

The SI unit of electric current is ampere.

To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit, we use a cell or a battery. A cell
generates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V).
Resistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls
the magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Q).

Ohm ’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly
proportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.
The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of
cross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.

The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of their
individual resistances.

A set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance R, given by
1 1 1 1

The electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by

W=VxIxt

The unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when 1 A of current
flows at a potential difference of 1 V.

The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt hour (kWh).
1 kW h = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 x 108 J.
