Since so little energy is available for the
next level of consumers, food chains
generally consist of only three or four
steps. The loss of energy at each step is
so great that very little usable energy
remains after four trophic levels.

There are generally a greater number
of individuals at the lower trophic levels
of an ecosystem, the greatest number
is of the producers.

The length and complexity of food
chains vary greatly. Each organism is
generally eaten by two or more other
kinds of organisms which in turn are
eaten by several other organisms. So
instead of a straight line food chain, the
relationship can be shown as a series
of branching lines called a food web
(Fig. 15.3).

From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 15.4),
two things become clear. Firstly, the flow of
energy is unidirectional. The energy that is
captured by the autotrophs does not revert
back to the solar input and the energy which
passes to the herbivores does not come back
to autotrophs. As it moves progressively
through the various trophic levels it is no
longer available to the previous level.
