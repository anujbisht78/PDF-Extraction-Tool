CHAPTER 1 5

Our Environment
a,

WE have heard the word ‘environment’ often being used on the
television, in newspapers and by people around us. Our elders tell
us that the ‘environment’ is not what it used to be earlier; others say that
we should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving
the developed and developing countries are regularity held to discuss
‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how various
factors in the environment interact with each other and how we impact
the environment. In Class IX, we saw how different materials are cycled
in the environment in separate biogeochemical cycles. In these cycles,
essential nutrients like nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and water are changed
from one form to another. We shall now see how human activities affect
these cycles.

15.1 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD OUR WASTE TO
THE ENVIRONMENT?

In our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown
away. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we
throw them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these
questions.

Activity 15.1

Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all
the waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,
vegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),
waste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and
torn clothes and broken footwear.

Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no
space available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/
flower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.

Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.

What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods
of time?

What are the materials which change their form and structure
over time?

Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the
fastest?
