Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (12.5)], we get

This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The
law implies that heat produced in a resistor is
(i) directly proportional to the square of current
for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to
resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly
proportional to the time for which the current flows
through the resistor. In practical situations, when
an electric appliance is connected to a known
voltage source, Eq. (12.21) is used after
calculating the current through it, using the Figure 12.13
relation I= V/R. A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit

An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is
at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.
The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each
case?

From Eq. (12.19), we know that the power input is
P=VI
Thus the current I= P/V
(a) When heating is at the maximum rate,
I= 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R= V/I= 220 V/3.82 A= 57.60 Q.
(b) When heating is at the minimum rate,
I= 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R=V/I= 220 V/1.64 A= 134.15Q.

100 J of heat are produced each second in a 4 Q resistance. Find the
potential difference across the resistor.

H=100J, R=4Q0,t=1s, V=?
From Eq. (12.21) we have the current through the resistor as
I = V(H/RO
V[100 J/(4Q2x1s)]

= 5A
Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (12.5)] is
V = IR
5AX4Q
20 V.
