. Twolamps, one rated 100 W at 220 V, and the other 60 W at 220 V, are connected

in parallel to electric mains supply. What current is drawn from the line if the supply
voltage is 220 V?

. Which uses more energy, a 250 W TV set in 1 hr, or a 1200 W toaster in 10 minutes?
. An electric heater of resistance 8 Q draws 15 A from the service mains 2 hours.
